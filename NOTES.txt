I've found this tool called GDAL which can convert shape/geoJSON data to raster format.  
It is the tool that shows up most when searching for rasterization of vector data.
The output formats do not include PNG, but geotiff or many of the other formats it does output 
in easily convert to PNG or anything else we need.  

I've downloaded it, and it runs to completion with no errors using either the .shp 
or .json files from the website you linked me.  However, my viewer doesn't seem 
able to show them, so I think something is not quite right.  Many people use this, so
I don't think it is written wrong.  Here are links to the download, and gdal_rasterize documentation.  
I've attached some of the output files I made using GDAL.  merica.shp, merica.shx, and merica.json are shape files from the website you linked me.

this is the command I used:
gdal_rasterize -burn 55 -ts 200 100 -of GTIFF -a_nodata -9999 -init 0 merica.shp tmp.tif
