I've found this tool called GDAL which can convert shape/geoJSON data to raster format.  
It is the tool that shows up most when searching for rasterization of vector data.
The output formats do not include PNG, but geotiff or many of the other formats it does output 
in easily convert to PNG or anything else we need.  

I've downloaded it, and it runs to completion with no errors using either the .shp 
or .json files from the website you linked me.  However, my viewer doesn't seem 
able to show them, so I think something is not quite right.  Many people use this, so
I don't think it is written wrong.  Here are links to the download, and gdal_rasterize documentation.  
I've attached some of the output files I made using GDAL.  merica.shp, merica.shx, and merica.json are shape files from the website you linked me.

this is the command I used:
gdal_rasterize -burn 55 -ts 200 100 -of GTIFF -a_nodata -9999 -init 0 merica.shp tmp.tif

UPDATE (later that evening...):

Okay, got it to work.  Couldn't open it because the default output type was 64 bit floats, who knew.  Anyway, I'll play around with it a little more and update some photos.

Since last time, I have figured out how to use QGIS to perform joins on Shape data we have to add attributes such as population density.  Next step with regards to this
is to automate it in a script and figure out how to construct new columns as functions of existing ones.  gldatransform and gdalwarp are easy to use command line
programs which can take EPSG code for a coordinate system, as well as lat/long bounds to reproject maps.  I have run CART on a fully constructed dataset where we started
with only a shape file and CSV of densities, changed these into an ASCII raster file where each point was a density.  The input and output to cart are in the folder Cart-maps.
